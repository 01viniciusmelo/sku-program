# sku-program

A simple stock keeping program written entirely in PHP. 
Great for personal, small-business use. 
Easy integration with existing POS systems. 
You will need your own database.

Download and use for free. I would not recommend commerical use or online because there are many security flaws (unsanitized input and so forth). 
But you can run this off a local machine.
